# Groovy NullPointerException Handling

This example demonstrates a common issue in Groovy related to null pointer exceptions and how to mitigate them.

The `calculate` function is designed to add two numbers.  However, without explicit null checks, attempting to add a null value would result in a `NullPointerException`.  The provided solution shows how to address this by checking for null values before performing the addition.

This is a simplified illustration.  In more complex scenarios, it's crucial to thoroughly handle potential null values to prevent unexpected program behavior.
